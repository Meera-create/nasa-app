Title of Technical Test: Nasa App

For this technical task, I had to build a React App that allows someone to search for images, where an API endpoint was given , with all the images provided.

Information about the App:
The app was built with React.
The testing utilities used were Jest and the React Testing Library.
Packages used were Axios.

Instructions for Use:

Run npm install - once the app is cloned.
Run npm start - to render the app in the browser.
Once rendered, you can search for images in the search box. Images should be displayed underneath.

Additions I would want to make:
I would like to display more information if the user clicked or hovered on the image for example, where it was taken or a description of what it is.
